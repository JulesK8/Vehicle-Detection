Note: A review paper related to this list is expected to be published in IEEE Transactions.  
The paper is currently under review. I will keep updating this repo for the latest works in  
vehicle detection field, and i will provide the link for the paper after publication.   
If you find that the paper contents are useful, please cite this paper in your work.  

# Intro  
Efficient and accurate vehicle detection is one of the essential tasks in the environment  
perception of an autonomous vehicle. Therefore, numerous  algorithms for vehicle detection  
have been developed.
