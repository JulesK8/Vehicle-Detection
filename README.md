> **Note:**   
> A review paper related to this list is expected to be published in IEEE Transactions.  
The paper is currently under review. I will keep updating this repo for the latest works in  
vehicle detection field, and i will provide the link for the paper after publication.   
If you find that the paper contents are useful, please cite this paper in your work.  

# Intro  
Efficient and accurate vehicle detection is one of the essential tasks in the environment  
perception of an autonomous vehicle. Therefore, numerous  algorithms for vehicle detection  
have been developed. 

# Datasets  
A more detailed table about datasets used in vehicle detection can be found on page 4 and 5 of my  
review paper.  

**Comments**  
Some of the most known datasets for vehicle detection include KITTI datasets, nuScene,  Waymo open datasets,  
ApolloScape, CityScape, Oxford radar robot car, H3D, Lyft level 5, Pandasets, ONCE (one million scenes), AIO Drive,  
Ford multi-AV seasonal dataset, DDAD, CADC (canadian adverse driving conditions), A2D2, A*3D dataset, Argoverse,  
BLVD (building a large-scale 5D semantics benchmark for autonomous driving), Rope3D, Itacha365.
